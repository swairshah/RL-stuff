# RL-Stuff

RL/MDP code and experiments.

I'm also picking up Julia along the way. The code is a mix of Julia and
Python. 

The Julia repositories that are very helpful to me in the process are:

https://github.com/JuliaReinforcementLearning/ReinforcementLearning.jl
https://github.com/JuliaReinforcementLearning/ReinforcementLearningEnvironments.jl

The following repository has Julia implementation of examples from Sutton and
Barto:
https://github.com/JuliaReinforcementLearning/ReinforcementLearningAnIntroduction.jl

The equivalent Python repository is the following:
https://github.com/ShangtongZhang/reinforcement-learning-an-introduction

For RL theory I'm following David Silver's Lectures and Sutton and Barto's
Book.
